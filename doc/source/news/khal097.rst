`khal v0.9.7`_ comes with two fixes (no more crashing on datetime events with
UNTIL properties and no more crashes on search finding events with overwritten
subevents) and one change: `search` will now print subevents of matching events
once, i.e., that is one line for the master event, and one line for every
different overwritten event.
