The [calendars] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *[calendars]* is mandatory and must contain at least one subsection.
Every subsection must have a unique name (enclosed by two square brackets).
Each subection needs exactly one *path* setting, everything else is optional.
Here is a small example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/configs/small.conf
 :language: ini

.. _calendars-type:

.. object:: type

    
    Set the type of this collection, the default is ``calendar``.
    If set to ``birthdays`` khal will expect a VCARD collection and extract
    birthdays from those VCARDS. ``birthdays`` also implies ``readonly=True``.
    If set to ``calendar`` only files with the ``.ics`` extension will be used
    and if set to ``birthdays`` only files with the ``.vcf`` extension will be
    used.

      :type: option, allowed values are *calendar* and *birthdays*
      :default: calendar

.. _calendars-path:

.. object:: path

    The path to an existing directory where this calendar is saved as a *vdir*.
    The directory is searched for events or birthdays (see ``type``) but the
    search is not recursive.

      :type: string
      :default: None

.. _calendars-readonly:

.. object:: readonly

    
    setting this to *True*, will keep khal from making any changes to this
    calendar

      :type: boolean
      :default: False

.. _calendars-color:

.. object:: color

    
    khal will use this color for coloring this calendar's event.
    The following color names are supported: *black*, *white*, *brown*, *yellow*,
    *dark gray*, *dark green*, *dark blue*, *light gray*, *light green*, *light
    blue*, *dark magenta*, *dark cyan*, *dark red*, *light magenta*, *light
    cyan*, *light red*
    Depending on your terminal emulator's settings, they might look different
    than what their name implies.
    In addition to the 16 named colors an index from the 256-color paltte or a
    24-bit color code can be used, if your terminal supports this.
    The 256-color paltte index is simply a number between 0 and 255.
    The 24-bit color must be given as #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, BB is the
    hexadecimal value of the red, green and blue component, respectively.
    When using a 24-bit color, make sure to enclose the color value in ' or "!
    If the color is set to '' (the default), the default_color (see below) is
    used.

      :type: color
      :default: 

The [sqlite] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. _sqlite-path:

.. object:: path

    khal stores its internal caching database here, by default this will be in the *$XDG_DATA_HOME/khal/khal.db* (this will most likely be *~/.local/share/khal/khal.db*).

      :type: string
      :default: None

The [locale] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most important options in the the **[locale]** section are probably (long-)time and dateformat.

.. _locale-unicode_symbols:

.. object:: unicode_symbols

    
    by default khal uses some unicode symbols (as in 'non-ascii') as indicators for things like repeating events,
    if your font, encoding etc. does not support those symbols, set this to *False* (this will enable ascii based replacements).

      :type: boolean
      :default: True

.. _locale-longdatetimeformat:

.. object:: longdatetimeformat

    
    khal will display and understand all datetimes in this format, it should
    contain a year (e.g. *%Y*) see :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format.

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m.%Y %H:%M

.. _locale-weeknumbers:

.. object:: weeknumbers

    
    
    Enable weeknumbers in `calendar` and `interactive` (ikhal) mode. As those are
    iso weeknumbers, they only work properly if `firstweekday` is set to 0

      :type: weeknumbers
      :default: off

.. _locale-datetimeformat:

.. object:: datetimeformat

    
    khal will display and understand all datetimes in this format, see
    :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format.

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m. %H:%M

.. _locale-dateformat:

.. object:: dateformat

    
    khal will display and understand all dates in this format, see :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m.

.. _locale-default_timezone:

.. object:: default_timezone

    
    this timezone will be used for new events (when no timezone is specified) and
    when khal does not understand the timezone specified in the icalendar file.
    If no timezone is set, the timezone your computer is set to will be used.

      :type: timezone
      :default: None

.. _locale-local_timezone:

.. object:: local_timezone

    
    khal will show all times in this timezone
    If no timezone is set, the timezone your computer is set to will be used.

      :type: timezone
      :default: None

.. _locale-longdateformat:

.. object:: longdateformat

    
    khal will display and understand all dates in this format, it should
    contain a year (e.g. *%Y*) see :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format.

      :default: %d.%m.%Y

.. _locale-timeformat:

.. object:: timeformat

    
    khal will display and understand all times in this format.
    
    The formatting string is interpreted as defined by Python's `strftime
    <https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime>`_, which is
    similar to the format specified in ``man strftime``.

      :type: string
      :default: %H:%M

.. object:: encoding

    
    set this to the encoding of your terminal emulator

    This is very much work in progress. Help is really welcome! The two currently
    available color schemes (*dark* and *light*) are defined in
    *khal/ui/themes.py*, you can either help improve those or create a new one
    (see below). As ikhal uses urwid, have a look at `urwid's documentation`__
    for how to set colors and/or at the existing schemes. If you cannot change
    the color of an element (or have any other problems) please open an issue on
    github_.
    
    If you want to create your own color scheme, just copy the structure of the
    existing ones, give it a new and unique name and also add it as an option in
    `khal/settings/khal.spec` in the section `[default]` of the property `theme`.
