03.04.2014: khal v0.1 released
  The first release of khal is here: khal v0.1.0(and also available on
  pypi now).

  The next release, hopefully coming rather sooner than later, will get
  rid of its own CalDAV implementation, but instead use vdirsyncer; you
  can already try it out via checking out the branch *vdir* at github.
