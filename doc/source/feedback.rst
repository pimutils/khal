Feedback
========

.. note::

    All participants must follow the `pimutils Code of Conduct
    <http://pimutils.org/coc>`_.

Please do provide feedback if *khal* works for you or even more importantly,
if it doesn't. Feature requests and other ideas on how to improve khal are also
welcome (see below).

In case you are not satisfied with khal, there are at least two other
projects with similar aims you might want to check out: calendar-cli_ (no
offline storage and a bit different scope) and gcalcli_ (only works with
google's calendar).

.. _gcalcli: https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli

Submitting a Bug
----------------
If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you expected, please
check if that bug is also present in the latest version from github (see
:doc:`install`) and is not already reported_ (you still might want to comment on
an already open issue).

If it isn't, please open a new bug.  In case you submit a new bug report,
please include:

 * how you ran khal (please run in verbose mode with `-v DEBUG`)
 * what you expected khal to do
 * what it did instead
 * everything khal printed to the screen (you may redact private details)
 * in case khal complains about a specific .ics file, please include that as
   well (or create a .ics which leads to the same error without any private
   information)
 * the version of khal and python you are using, which operating system you are
   using and how you installed khal

Suggesting Features
-------------------
If you believe khal is lacking a useful feature or some part of khal is not
working the way you think it should, please first check if there isn't already
a relevant issue_ for it and otherwise open a new one.
