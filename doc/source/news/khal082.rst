        :date: 2016-05-16

`khal v0.8.2`__ (pypi_) is a maintenance release that fixes several bugs in
`configure` that would lead to crashes during the initial configuration and
following runs of khal (due to an invalid configuration file getting written to
disk) and improves the detection of the installed icalendar version.

If khal currently works for you, there is no need for an upgrade.
