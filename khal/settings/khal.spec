[calendars]
# The *[calendars]* is mandatory and must contain at least one subsection.
# Every subsection must have a unique name (enclosed by two square brackets).
# Each subection needs exactly one *path* setting, everything else is optional.
# Here is a small example:
#
# .. literalinclude:: ../../tests/configs/small.conf
#  :language: ini
[[__many__]]
# The path to an existing directory where this calendar is saved as a *vdir*.
# The directory is searched for events or birthdays (see ``type``) but the
# search is not recursive.
path = expand_path(default=None)

# khal will use this color for coloring this calendar's event.
# The following color names are supported: *black*, *white*, *brown*, *yellow*,
# *dark gray*, *dark green*, *dark blue*, *light gray*, *light green*, *light
# blue*, *dark magenta*, *dark cyan*, *dark red*, *light magenta*, *light
# cyan*, *light red*.
# Depending on your terminal emulator's settings, they might look different
# than what their name implies.
# In addition to the 16 named colors an index from the 256-color paltte or a
# 24-bit color code can be used, if your terminal supports this.
# The 256-color paltte index is simply a number between 0 and 255.
# The 24-bit color must be given as #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, BB is the
# hexadecimal value of the red, green and blue component, respectively.
# When using a 24-bit color, make sure to enclose the color value in ' or "!
# If the color is set to *auto* (the default), khal tries to read the file
# *color* from this calendar's vdir, if this fails the default_color (see
# below) is used. If color is set to '', the default_color is always used.
color = color(default='auto')

# setting this to *True*, will keep khal from making any changes to this
# calendar

# Set the type of this collection, the default is ``calendar``.
# If set to ``birthdays`` khal will expect a VCARD collection and extract
# birthdays from those VCARDS. ``birthdays`` also implies ``readonly=True``.
# If set to ``calendar`` only files with the ``.ics`` extension will be used,
# if set to ``birthdays`` only files with the ``.vcf`` extension will be
# used, if it is set to ``discover`` khal will use all subdirectories
# of ``paths``'s that contain only ``.ics`` files.

# This is very much work in progress. Help is really welcome! The two currently
# available color schemes (*dark* and *light*) are defined in
# *khal/ui/themes.py*, you can either help improve those or create a new one

# for how to set colors and/or at the existing schemes. If you cannot change
# the color of an element (or have any other problems) please open an issue on
# github_.
#
# If you want to create your own color scheme, just copy the structure of the
# existing ones, give it a new and unique name and also add it as an option in
# `khal/settings/khal.spec` in the section `[default]` of the property `theme`.
