(as always, also on pypi_).

This release brings a lot of new features, by an ever increasing number of new
contributors (welcome everyone!). With highlighting of days that have events we
now have one of the most requested features implemented (because it does
noticeably slow down khal's start it is disabled by default, startup performance
will hopefully be increased soon). Among the other new features are duplicating
events (in ikhal), prettier event display (also in ikhal) and a better zsh
completion file.

Have a look at the changelog_ for more complete list of new features.
