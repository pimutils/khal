khal v0.9.0 released
====================

.. feed-entry::
        :date: 2017-01-24


This is probably the biggest release of khal to date, that is, the one with the
most changes since the last release. This changes are made up of a bunch of bug
fixes and enhancements.  Unfortunately, some of these break backwards
compatibility, many of which will make themselves noticeable, because your config
file will no longer be valid, consult the changelog_ or the documentation_.
Noticable is also, that command `agenda` has been renamed to `list`

Some of the larger changes include, among others, new configuration options on
how events are printed (thanks to first time contributor Taylor Money) and a new
look for ikhal's event-list column.

Have a look at the changelog_ for more complete list of new features (of which
there are many).
