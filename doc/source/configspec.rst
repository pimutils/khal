    This file gets generated from `khal/khal/settings/khal.spec`. Please edit
    that file instead and then run `make` in `khal/doc/'.


The [calendars] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *[calendars]* section is mandatory and must contain at least one subsection.
Every subsection must have a unique name (enclosed by two square brackets).
Each subsection needs exactly one *path* setting, everything else is optional.
Here is a small example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../tests/configs/small.conf
 :language: ini

.. _calendars-color:

.. object:: color

    
    khal will use this color for coloring this calendar's event.
    The following color names are supported: *black*, *white*, *brown*, *yellow*,
    *dark gray*, *dark green*, *dark blue*, *light gray*, *light green*, *light
    blue*, *dark magenta*, *dark cyan*, *dark red*, *light magenta*, *light
    cyan*, *light red*.
    Depending on your terminal emulator's settings, they might look different
    than what their name implies.
    In addition to the 16 named colors an index from the 256-color palette or a
    24-bit color code can be used, if your terminal supports this.
    The 256-color palette index is simply a number between 0 and 255.
    The 24-bit color must be given as #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, BB is the
    hexadecimal value of the red, green and blue component, respectively.
    When using a 24-bit color, make sure to enclose the color value in ' or "!
    If the color is set to *auto* (the default), khal tries to read the file
    *color* from this calendar's vdir, if this fails the default_color (see
    below) is used. If color is set to '', the default_color is always used.

      :type: color
      :default: auto

.. _calendars-path:

.. object:: path

    The path to an existing directory where this calendar is saved as a *vdir*.
    The directory is searched for events or birthdays (see ``type``). The path
    also accepts glob expansion via `*` or `?` when type is set to discover.
    This allows for paths such as `~/accounts/*/calendars/*`, where the
    calendars directory contains vdir directories. In addition, `~/calendars/*`
    and `~/calendars/default` are valid paths if there exists a vdir in the
    `default` directory. (The previous behaviour of recursively searching
    directories has been replaced with globbing).

      :type: string
      :default: None

.. _calendars-readonly:

.. object:: readonly

    
    setting this to *True*, will keep khal from making any changes to this
    calendar

      :type: boolean
      :default: False

.. _calendars-type:

.. object:: type

    
    Setting the type of this collection (default ``calendar``).
    
    If set to ``calendar`` (the default), this collection will be used as a
    standard calendar, that is, only files with the ``.ics`` extension will be
    considered, all other files are ignored (except for a possible `color` file).
    
    If set to ``birthdays`` khal will expect a VCARD collection and extract
    birthdays from those VCARDS, that is only files with ``.ics`` extension will
    be considered, all other files will be ignored.  ``birthdays`` also implies
    ``readonly=True``.
    
    If set to ``discover``, khal will use
    `globbing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`_ to expand this
    calendar's `path` to (possibly) several paths and use those as individual
    calendars (this cannot be used with `birthday` collections`). See `Examplary
    discover usage`_ for an example.
    
    If an individual calendar vdir has a `color` file, the calendar's color will
    be set to the one specified in the `color` file, otherwise the color from the
    *calendars* subsection will be used.

      :type: option, allowed values are *calendar*, *birthdays* and *discover*
      :default: calendar

The [default] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Some default values and behaviours are set here.

.. _default-default_calendar:

.. object:: default_calendar

    
    The calendar to use if none is specified for some operation (e.g. if adding a

      :default: False

.. _default-show_all_days:

.. object:: show_all_days

The [locale] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is mandatory to set (long)date-, time-, and datetimeformat options, all others options in the **[locale]** section are optional and have (sensible) defaults.

.. _locale-dateformat:

.. object:: dateformat

    
    khal will display and understand all dates in this format, see :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m.

.. _locale-datetimeformat:

.. object:: datetimeformat

    
    khal will display and understand all datetimes in this format, see
    :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format.

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m. %H:%M

.. _locale-default_timezone:

.. object:: default_timezone

    
    this timezone will be used for new events (when no timezone is specified) and
    when khal does not understand the timezone specified in the icalendar file.
    If no timezone is set, the timezone your computer is set to will be used.

      :type: timezone
      :default: None

.. _locale-firstweekday:

.. object:: firstweekday

    
    the first day of the week, were Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6

      :type: integer, allowed values are between 0 and 6
      :default: 0

.. _locale-local_timezone:

.. object:: local_timezone

    
    khal will show all times in this timezone
    If no timezone is set, the timezone your computer is set to will be used.

      :type: timezone
      :default: None

.. _locale-longdateformat:

.. object:: longdateformat

    
    khal will display and understand all dates in this format, it should
    contain a year (e.g. *%Y*) see :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format.

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m.%Y

.. _locale-longdatetimeformat:

.. object:: longdatetimeformat

    
    khal will display and understand all datetimes in this format, it should
    contain a year (e.g. *%Y*) see :ref:`timeformat <locale-timeformat>` for the format.

      :type: string
      :default: %d.%m.%Y %H:%M

.. _locale-timeformat:

.. object:: timeformat

    
    khal will display and understand all times in this format.
    
    The formatting string is interpreted as defined by Python's `strftime
    <https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime>`_, which is
    similar to the format specified in ``man strftime``.

      :type: string
      :default: %H:%M

.. _locale-unicode_symbols:

.. object:: unicode_symbols

    
    by default khal uses some unicode symbols (as in 'non-ascii') as indicators for things like repeating events,
    if your font, encoding etc. does not support those symbols, set this to *False* (this will enable ascii based replacements).

      :type: boolean
      :default: True

.. _locale-weeknumbers:

.. object:: weeknumbers

    
    
    Enable weeknumbers in `calendar` and `interactive` (ikhal) mode. As those are
    iso weeknumbers, they only work properly if `firstweekday` is set to 0

      :type: weeknumbers
      :default: off

The [sqlite] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. _sqlite-path:

.. object:: path

    khal stores its internal caching database here, by default this will be in the *$XDG_DATA_HOME/khal/khal.db* (this will most likely be *~/.local/share/khal/khal.db*).

      :type: string
      :default: None

The [view] section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The view section contains configuration options that effect the visual appearance
when using ikhal.

.. _view-agenda_day_format:

.. object:: agenda_day_format

    
    Specifies how each *day header* is formated.

      :type: string
      :default: {bold}{name}, {date-long}{reset}

.. _view-agenda_event_format:

.. object:: agenda_event_format

    
    Default formating for events used when the user asks for all events in a
    given time range, used for :command:`list`, :command:`calendar` and in
    :command:`interactive` (ikhal). Please note, that any color styling will be
    ignored in `ikhal`, where events will always be shown in the color of the
    calendar they belong to.
    The syntax is the same as for :option:`--format`.

      :type: string
      :default: {calendar-color}{start-end-time-style} {title}{repeat-symbol}{description-separator}{description}{reset}

.. _view-bold_for_light_color:

.. object:: bold_for_light_color

    
    Whether to use bold text for light colors or not. Non-bold light colors may
    not work on all terminals but allow using light background colors.

      :type: boolean
      :default: True

.. _view-dynamic_days:

.. object:: dynamic_days

    
    Defines the behaviour of ikhal's right column. If `True`, the right column
    will show events for as many days as fit, moving the cursor through the list
    will also select the appropriate day in the calendar column on the left. If
    `False`, only a fixed ([default] timedelta) amount of days' events will be
    shown, moving through events will not change the focus in the left column.

      :type: boolean
      :default: True

.. _view-event_format:

.. object:: event_format

    
    Default formating for events used when the start- and end-date are not clear
    through context, e.g. for :command:`search`, used almost everywhere but
    :command:`list` and :command:`calendar`. It is therefore probably a sensible
    choice to include the start- and end-date.
    The syntax is the same as for :option:`--format`.

      :type: string
      :default: {calendar-color}{start}-{end} {title}{repeat-symbol}{description-separator}{description}{reset}

.. _view-event_view_always_visible:

.. object:: event_view_always_visible

    
    Set to true to always show the event view window when looking at the event list

      :type: boolean
      :default: False

.. _view-event_view_weighting:

.. object:: event_view_weighting

    
    weighting that is applied to the event view window

      :type: integer
      :default: 1

.. _view-frame:

.. object:: frame

    
    Whether to show a visible frame (with *box drawing* characters) around some
    (groups of) elements or not. There are currently several different frame
    options available, that should visually differentiate wether an element is
    in focus or not. Some of them will probably be removed in future releases of
    khal, so please try them out and give feedback on which style you prefer (the
    color of all variants can be defined in the color themes).

      :type: option, allowed values are *False*, *width*, *color* and *top*
      :default: False

.. _view-theme:

.. object:: theme

    
    Choose a color theme for khal.
    
    This is very much work in progress. Help is really welcome! The two currently
    available color schemes (*dark* and *light*) are defined in
    *khal/ui/colors.py*, you can either help improve those or create a new one
    (see below). As ikhal uses urwid, have a look at `urwid's documentation`__
    for how to set colors and/or at the existing schemes. If you cannot change
    the color of an element (or have any other problems) please open an issue on
    github_.
    
    If you want to create your own color scheme, copy the structure of the
    existing ones, give it a new and unique name and also add it as an option in
    `khal/settings/khal.spec` in the section `[default]` of the property `theme`.
