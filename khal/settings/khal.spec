[calendars]
# The *[calendars]* section is mandatory and must contain at least one subsection.
# Every subsection must have a unique name (enclosed by two square brackets).
# Each subsection needs exactly one *path* setting, everything else is optional.
# Here is a small example:
#
# .. literalinclude:: ../../tests/configs/small.conf
#  :language: ini
[[__many__]]
# The path to an existing directory where this calendar is saved as a *vdir*.
# The directory is searched for events or birthdays (see ``type``). The path
# also accepts glob expansion via `*` or `?` when type is set to discover.
# This allows for paths such as `~/accounts/*/calendars/*`, where the
# calendars directory contains vdir directories. In addition, `~/calendars/*`
# and `~/calendars/default` are valid paths if there exists a vdir in the
# `default` directory. (The previous behavior of recursively searching
# directories has been replaced with globbing).
path = expand_path(default=None)

# khal will use this color for coloring this calendar's event.
# The following color names are supported: *black*, *white*, *brown*, *yellow*,
# *dark gray*, *dark green*, *dark blue*, *light gray*, *light green*, *light
# blue*, *dark magenta*, *dark cyan*, *dark red*, *light magenta*, *light
# cyan*, *light red*.
# Depending on your terminal emulator's settings, they might look different
# than what their name implies.
# In addition to the 16 named colors an index from the 256-color palette or a
# 24-bit color code can be used, if your terminal supports this.
# The 256-color palette index is simply a number between 0 and 255.
# The 24-bit color must be given as #RRGGBB, where RR, GG, BB is the
# hexadecimal value of the red, green and blue component, respectively.
# When using a 24-bit color, make sure to enclose the color value in ' or "!
# If `color` is set to *auto* (the default), khal looks for a color value in a
# *color* file in this calendar's vdir. If the *color* file does not exist, the 
# default_color (see below) is used. If color is set to '', the default_color is 
# always used. Note that you can use `vdirsyncer metasync` to synchronize colors 
# with your caldav server. 

color = color(default='auto')

# When coloring days, the color will be determined based on the calendar with
# the highest priority. If the priorities are equal, then the "multiple" color
# will be used.

# setting this to *True*, will keep khal from making any changes to this
# calendar

# Setting the type of this collection (default ``calendar``).
#
# If set to ``calendar`` (the default), this collection will be used as a
# standard calendar, that is, only files with the ``.ics`` extension will be
# considered, all other files are ignored (except for a possible `color` file).
#
# If set to ``birthdays`` khal will expect a VCARD collection and extract
# birthdays from those VCARDS, that is only files with ``.vcf`` extension will
# be considered, all other files will be ignored.  ``birthdays`` also implies
# ``readonly=True``.
#
# If set to ``discover``, khal will use
# `globbing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`_ to expand this
# calendar's `path` to (possibly) several paths and use those as individual
# calendars (this cannot be used with `birthday` collections`). See `Exemplary
# discover usage`_ for an example.
#
# If an individual calendar vdir has a `color` file, the calendar's color will
# be set to the one specified in the `color` file, otherwise the color from the
# *calendars* subsection will be used.

# If you want to create your own color scheme, copy the structure of the
# existing ones, give it a new and unique name and also add it as an option in
