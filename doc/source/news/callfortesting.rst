While there isn't a release yet, *khal* is, at least partly, in a usable shape
by now. Please report any errors you stumble upon and improvement suggestions
you have either via email or github_ (if you don't have any privacy concerns
etc. I'd prefer you use github since it is public, but I'll soon set up a
mailing list).  TODO.rst_ gives you an idea about the plans I currently have
for *khal*'s near future.
