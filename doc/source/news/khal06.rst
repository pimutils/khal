====================

        :date: 2015-07-15


Only six weeks after the last version `khal v0.6.0`__ is now available  (yes,
also on pypi_).

__ https://lostpackets.de/khal/downloads/khal-0.6.0.tar.gz

This release fixes an unfortunate bug which could lead to wrong shifts in other
events when inserting complicated recurring events. All users are therefore
advised to quickly upgrade to khal 0.6.

There are also quite a bunch of new features, among other nicer editing
capabilities in ikhal's text edits and import of .ics files. For a more
detailed list of changes, please have a look at the changelog_ (especially if
you package khal).
