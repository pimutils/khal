A new release of khal is here: `khal v0.2.0`__ (also available on pypi_).

If you want to update your installation from pypi_, you can run `sudo pip
install --upgrade khal`.

From now on *khal* relies on vdirsyncer_ for CalDAV sync. While this makes
*khal* a bit more complicated to setup, *vdirsyncer* is much better tested than
*khal* and also the `bus factor`__ increased (at least for parts of the
project).

You might want to head over to the tutorial_ on how to setup *vdirsyncer*.
Afterwards you will need to re-setup your *khal* configuration (copy the new
example config file), also you will need to delete your old (local) database, so
please make sure you did sync everything.

Also *khal*'s command line syntax changed quite a bit, so you might want to head over the documentation_.
