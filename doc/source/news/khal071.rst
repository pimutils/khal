khal v0.7.1 released
====================

        :date: 2016-10-11

`khal v0.7.1`_ (pypi_) is a bugfix release that fixes a **critical bug** in
`khal import`. This is a backport of the fix that got released with v0.8.4_, for
those users than cannot (or *really* don't want to) upgrade to a more recent
version of khal (most likely because of the dropped support for python 2).
Please note, that khal v0.7.x is generally *not maintained* anymore, will not
receive any new features, and any non-critical bugs will not be fixed either.

See the `0.8.4 release announcement`_ for more details regarding the fixed bug.
