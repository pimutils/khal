Feedback and Contributing
=========================

The preferred way of interaction with *khal*'s developers is via github_. But if
you do not feel comfortable using github, please don't hesitate to contact the
original developer via email (khal at lostpackets dot de) or via jabber/XMPP
(geier at jabber dot ccc dot de).

Feedback
--------
Please do provide feedback if *khal* works for you or even more importantly
if it doesn't. Feature requests and other ideas on how to improve khal are also
welcome.

In case you are not satisfied with khal, there are at least two other projects
with similar aim you might want to check out: calendar-cli_ (no
offline storage and a bit different scope) and gcalcli_ (only works with
google's calendar).

.. _calendar-cli: https://github.com/tobixen/calendar-cli
.. _gcalcli: https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli

Submitting a Bug
----------------
If you found a bug or any part of khal isn't working as you
expected, please check if that bug is either already reported at

https://github.com/geier/khal/issues?state=open

If it isn't, always run the command again with the -v option
and paste the output of that (of course you can edit out any private
details).
