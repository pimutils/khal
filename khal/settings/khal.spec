[calendars]
# The *[calendars]* is mandatory and must contain at least one subsection.
# Every subsection must have a unique name (enclosed by two square brackets).
# Each subection needs exactly one *path* setting, everything else is optional.
# Here is a small example:
#
# .. literalinclude:: ../../tests/configs/small.conf
#  :language: ini
[[__many__]]
# the path to a *vdir* where this calendar is saved
path = expand_path(default=None)

# khal will use this color for coloring this calendar's event. Depending on
# your terminal emulator's settings, they might look different than what their
# name implies.

# calendar
