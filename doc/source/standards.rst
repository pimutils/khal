Standard Compliance
===================

*khal* tries to follow standards and RFCs (most importantly :rfc:`5545`
*iCalendar*) where ever possible. Known intentional and unintentional deviations
are listed below.

RDATE;VALUE=PERIOD
------------------

`RDATE` s with `PERIOD` values are currently not supported, as icalendar_ does
does not support it yet. Please submit any real world examples of events with
`RDATE;VALUE=PERIOD` you might encounter (khal will print warnings if you have
any in your calendars).

RANGE=THISANDPRIOR
------------------

Recurrent events with the `RANGE=THISANDPRIOR` are and will not be [1]_
supported by khal, as applications supporting the latest standard_ MUST NOT
create those. khal will print a warning if it encounters an event containing
`RANGE=THISANDPRIOR`.

Events with neither END nor DURATION
------------------------------------

While the RFC states::

   A calendar entry with a "DTSTART" property but no "DTEND"
   property does not take up any time. It is intended to represent
   an event that is associated with a given calendar date and time
   of day, such as an anniversary. Since the event does not take up
   any time, it MUST NOT be used to record busy time no matter what
   the value for the "TRANSP" property.

khal transforms those events into all-day events lasting for one day (the start
date). As long a those events do not get edited, these changes will not be
written to the vdir (and with that to the CalDAV server). Any timezone
information that was associated with the start date gets discarded.

.. note::
  While the main rationale for this behaviour was laziness on part of the main
  author of khal, other calendar software shows the same behaviour (e.g. Google
  Calendar and Evolution).

Timezones
=========
Getting localized time right, seems to be the most difficult part about
calendaring (and messing it up ends in missing the one important meeting of the
week). So I'll briefly describe here, how khal tries to handle timezone
information, which information it can handle and which it can't.

In general, there are two different type of events. *Localized events* (with
*localized* start and end datetimes) which have timezone information attached to
their start and end datetimes, and *floating* events (with *floating* start and end
datetimes), which have no timezone information attached (all-day events, events that
last for complete days are floating as well). Localized events are always
observed at the same UTC_ (no matter what time zone the observer is in), but
different local times. On the other hand, floating events are always observed at
the same local time, which might be different in UTC.

In khal all localized datetimes are saved to the local database as UTC.
Datetimes that are already UTC, e.g. ``19980119T070000Z``, are saved as such,
others are converted to UTC (but don't worry, the timezone information does not
get lost). Floating events get saved in floating time, independently of the
localized events.

If you want to look up which events take place at a specified datetime, khal
always expects that you want to know what events take place at that *local*
datetime. Therefore, the datetime you asked for gets converted to UTC, the
appropriate *localized* events get selected and presented with their start and
end datetimes *converted* to *your local datetime*. For floating events no
conversion is necessary.

Khal (i.e. icalendar_) can understand all timezone identifiers as used in the
`Olson DB`_ and custom timezone definitions, if those VTIMEZONE components are
placed before the VEVENTS that make use of them (as most calendar programs seem
to do). In case a unknown (or unsupported) timezone is found, khal will assume
you want that event to be placed in the *default timezone* (which can be
configured in the configuration file as well).

khal expects you *always* want *all* start and end datetimes displayed in
*local time* (which can be set in the configuration file as well, otherwise
your computer's timezone is used).
