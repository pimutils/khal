        :date: 2014-04-03

The first release of khal is here: `khal v0.1.0`__ (and also available on pypi_
now).

The next release, hopefully coming rather sooner than later, will get rid of its
own CalDAV implementation, but instead use vdirsyncer_; you can
already try it out via checking out the branch *vdir* at github_.
