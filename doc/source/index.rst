Features
--------
(or rather: limitations)

- khal can read and write events/icalendars to vdir_, so vdirsyncer_ can be
  used to `synchronize calendars with a variety of other programs`__, for
  example CalDAV_ servers.
- fast and easy way to add new events
- ikhal (interactive khal) lets you browse and edit calendars and events
- only rudimentary support for creating and editing recursion rules
- you cannot edit the timezones of events
- works with python 3.6+
- khal should run on all major operating systems [1]_
